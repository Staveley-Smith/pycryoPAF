# pycryoPAF
Python spectral-line data reduction routines for the Parkes/Murriyang cryoPAF receiver

Introduction

This document describes the use of various routines to calibrate and image spectral-line data from the cryoPAF instrument on the Parkes/Murriyang telescope using the pycryoPAF suite of python routines. The routines were developed for the purposes of rapid scientific commissioning and are not intended to be of National Facility standard. Bugs may not be fixed and the routines may not be interoperable with future upgrades of the SDHDF data format or with all modes of spectral-line observing (e.g. binned pulsar mode). The output format is SDHDF for spectral data and FITS for image data. The code is written using widely available python modules. It is available on a shared-risk basis and may be modified or shared according to CC BY-NC. You are welcome to contact the author with queries and bug reports.
